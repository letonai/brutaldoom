* What's New *
February 18, 2002
-Thanks to Alexis ( alexis_aiello@topmail.com.ar ) for fixing
some mistakes in the origanal JPTR_FIX.WAD

-I added demos to the JPTR_FIX.WAD to prevent crashing


* Play Information *
JPTR_FIX.WAD will only replace the demos found in JPTR_V40.WAD
to prevent crashing, nothing else found in JPTR_V40.WAD is
effected by the JPTR_FIX.WAD


Description             : JPTR_FIX.WAD
                          This will replaces the old demos
                          with new ones to prevent crashing in
                          Doom v1.9, the new demos are fairly
                          accurate reenactments of the original
                          demos.
                          All intermission level name graphics
                          with DOOM: THE LOST EPISODES level
                          names found in THE LOST EPISODES OF
                          DOOM book. And for THE ULTIMATE DOOM
                          the episode title "Thy Flesh Consumed"
                          is adjusted and adds a new menu bar.

                          JPTR_FIX.BEX
                          This changes map names in automap
                          and replaces text at the end of each
                          episode with adjusted quotes
                          from THE LOST EPISODES OF DOOM book
                          (pages p.107, 154, and 200).
